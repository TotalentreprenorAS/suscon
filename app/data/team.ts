    summary: "While nature already sets harsh conditions for the organisms living therein, human activities can add additional constraints to the natural environment. It is therefore essential to understand how we influence our environment if we want to construct a living environment that is both sustainable and safeguarding human health. I am an ecologist and environmental scientist, and have developed innovative tools to monitor ecosystem health and unraveled mechanisms by which human-induced stressors effect organisms and ecosystem processes. My key areas of expertise are: Toxicology(Chemical, Physical); Urban ecology; Biodiversity & Environmental Impact Assessments; Biotechnological Innovation; Proposal Development."

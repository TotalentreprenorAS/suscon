It is therefore essential to understand how we influence our environment if we want to construct a living environment that is both sustainable and safeguarding human health. I am an ecologist and environmental scientist, and have developed innovative tools to monitor ecosystem health and unraveled mechanisms by which human-induced stressors effect organisms and ecosystem processes.
